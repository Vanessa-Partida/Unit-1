# Make a function called area that
# will return the area of any n-sided
# shape with a length of side_length

# Make a function that will return 
# the area of circle with radius r

# Ask a user if their shape is a polygon
# or a circle. Then ask them for a side length and number
# of sides or for a radius.
# Lastly, print the area of the shape in the
# following format:
# If it's a circle: The area of circle with radius __ is __
# Polygon: The area of a __-sided shape with side length __
#          is ____
# Use try/except to make sure the user enters numbers

def polygon_area
# ask how many sides and side length
# do math
# return area
def circle_area
# ask for radius
# do math
# return area

def main():
    # prompt them for type
    # call appopriate function
    # area = polygon_area() or area = circle_area() (you do parameters)
    # print area

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
